Hi, I'm Yu Zhengwen, a computer engineering and economics undergraduate. I'm passionate about
all things tech, whether it is software or hardware! With many years of programming and
tinkering, I am able to pick up new skills and solve problems efficiently.  

I've always managed to find time to develop my own projects outside of schoolwork, because
that's where I get to apply what I learnt, and what really gets me excited. I love it when
things work out, and when they don't, it sucks until it does again :D  
But nevertheless, it is always an opportunity to learn something new.  

I am currently seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and to contribute to
real world projects. I am eager to delve into new technologies, and work with experienced
people!  

Please feel free to take a look at the links below to see my work, or reach out to me if you
have any opportunities to discuss!
