## Why Stars

No need to manually plan your timetables.  

WhyStars' standout feature is that it will automatically generate valid timetables for you based on the courses you select, and the constraints that are given. Not happy with the generated timetables? You can still manually play around with your timings with the beautiful timetable user interface.  

Don't worry if you closed the website accidentally, because your timetable will persist (locally). If you would like, you can create an account and save multiple timetables into your account! You will be able to load them in and access/edit your timetables from any device!
