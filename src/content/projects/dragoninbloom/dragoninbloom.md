## Dragon In Bloom

An upcoming video game with an engaging story, exciting combat, and gorgeous 2D art!

I am currently the sole developer, artist, animator, writer, etc. so progress has been slow but steady. Hopefully there will be a demo out soon. 

I am currently working on big systems for the game including a robust questing, inventory, skill tree system, alongside making sprites for different combat skills. The game's story has largely been planned out but specific progression and implementation still needs revision.

Here is the rough synopsis of the story:

After coexisting for hundreds of years ever since the Dragonian Treaty, where Humans and Dragons cease war to cohabit in the world together, a group of rogue dragons suddenly started attacking human towns. Our hero will step up as she assumes her legacy and learns the truth of the world on her eventual journey.
